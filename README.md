# Nim Solver

Anna Carrigan

Senior Project for University of Wyoming Honors Program

This is an application that allows the user to win at the game of Nim! (Haven't heard of it? Wikipedia has: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

User can set up a variation of Nim with up to six piles and either play against an AI or have the application tell them what move to make to beat their friend.
